3. Language used: Java

5. Compiling instructions: In order to compile the program, you will need to first open a terminal and then navigate to the directory where the "Monitor.java" file is located. 
Once you are in the correct directory, use the "Javac" java compiler to compile the "Monitor.java" file by typing "Javac Monitor.java" in the terminal. 
This action will result in the creation of a new file called "Monitor.class" in the same directory. To execute the compiled Monitor class, you will also 
need a text file that contains the list of URLs that you wish to monitor (named "urls-file.txt"). To complete the process, use the java command followed 
by the class name and the text file name as an argument: "java Monitor urls-file.txt".
